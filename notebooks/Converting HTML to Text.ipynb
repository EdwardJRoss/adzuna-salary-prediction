All classroom teachers may be required to undertake other duties in addition to their rostered teaching duties provided the responsibility is appropriate to the salary range, qualifications, training and experience of the teacher.<br/><br/><br/>Classroom teacher Range 2<br/>Range 2 classroom teachers play a significant role in assisting the school to improve student performance and educational outcomes determined by the school strategic plan and state-wide priorities and contributing to the development and implementation of school policies and priorities. <br/><br/>A critical component of this work will focus on increasing the knowledge base of staff within their school about student learning and high quality instruction to assist their school to define quality teacher practice.<br/><br/>Range 2 classroom teachers will be expected to:<br/>- Have the content knowledge and pedagogical practice to meet the diverse needs of all students<br/>- Model exemplary classroom practice and mentor/coach other teachers in the school to engage in critical reflection of their practice and to support staff to expand their capacity<br/>- Provide expert advice about the content, processes and strategies that will shape individual and school professional learning<br/>- Supervise and train one or more student teachers<br/>- Assist staff to use student data to inform teaching approaches that enable targets related to improving student learning outcomes to be achieved.<br/><br/><br/>Classroom teacher Range 1<br/>The primary focus of the range 1 classroom teacher is on further developing skills and competencies to become an effective classroom practitioner with structured support and guidance from teachers at higher levels and the planning, preparation and teaching of programs to achieve specific student outcomes. These teachers teach a range of students/classes and are accountable for the effective delivery of their programs.  Range 1 classroom teachers are skilled teachers who operate under general direction within clear guidelines following established work practices and documented priorities and may have responsibility for the supervision and training of one or more student teachers.<br/><br/>At range 1, teachers participate in the development of school policies and programs and assist in the implementation of school priorities.  <br/>The focus of a range 1 classroom teacher is on classroom management, subject content and teaching practice.  New entrants to the teaching profession in their initial teaching years receive structured support, mentoring and guidance from teachers at higher levels.<br/><br/>Under guidance, new entrants to the teaching profession will plan and teach student groups in one or more subjects and are expected to participate in induction programs and other professional learning activities that are designed to ensure the integration of curriculum, assessment and pedagogy across the school.<br/><br/>Teachers at range 1 are responsible for teaching their own classes and may also assist and participate in policy development, project teams and the organisation of co-curricula activities.</p><br/></div>\n",
